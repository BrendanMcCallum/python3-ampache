Heaven 17 was an obvious influence; however, the deep, ardent vocals of Kevin Patterson easily challenged any charges of plagiarism. Featuring Patterson, Chic Medley (guitars), Graham McGregor (bass), Eddie Jordan (keyboards), and Mike Ogletree (drums, percussion). Their biggest hit was Feels Like Heaven from 1984, from their debut album Throw the Warped Wheel Out. ",

Versailles' key characteristics are their rococo-esque costumes, dueling guitar sounds and heavy but melodic arrangements. The concept is a formula of \"absolute beauty and extreme aestheticism\". The duel guitars sound like rose vines grown riot over an agitated rhythm. Those sounds sketch the story of \"The Descendants of the Rose\". ",
