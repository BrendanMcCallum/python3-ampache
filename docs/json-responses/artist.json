        "summary": "Fiction Factory, formed in Perth, Scotland in 1982 wrote soulful, melancholic pop songs illuminated by danceable synthesized rhythms and funky bass lines. Heaven 17 was an obvious influence; however, the deep, ardent vocals of Kevin Patterson easily challenged any charges of plagiarism. Featuring Patterson, Chic Medley (guitars), Graham McGregor (bass), Eddie Jordan (keyboards), and Mike Ogletree (drums, percussion). Their biggest hit was Feels Like Heaven from 1984, from their debut album Throw the Warped Wheel Out. ",
