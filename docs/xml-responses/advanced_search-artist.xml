	<summary><![CDATA[Robert Rich (born August 23, 1963) is an ambient musician and composer based in San Francisco, California, United States.

With a musical career spanning three decades and over 30 albums, Robert Rich has helped define the genres of ambient music, dark ambient, tribal ambient and trance, yet his music remains hard to categorize. Part of his unique sound comes from using home-made acoustic and electronic instruments, microtonal harmonies, computer-based signal processing, chaotic systems and feedback networks. ]]></summary>
